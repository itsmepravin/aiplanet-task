## Project Details

- Made using React, SASS and Typescript.
- Learners are able to create, edit, and delete their submission. Every submission form has following fields:
  - Title
  - Summary
  - Description
  - Cover Image
  - Hackthon name
  - Hackthon start date
  - Hackthon end date
  - Github repository link
  - Other links(optional)
- Learners are able to see the list of submission where learner can search the submission using title.
- There are two tabs as outlined i.e. All Submissions and Favourite Submissions.
- When clicked on submission it takes them to page where learner can see all the data related to submission.
- On this page, learners are able to edit, delete the submission & by clicking on the star icon they can make that submission as their favorite, which is reflected in the main page immediately.

## Project Shortcomings

- The search functionality works only once and is not fully dynamic.
- The sorting functionality could not be implemented due to time issues.
